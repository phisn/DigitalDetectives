ESP8266 Boot
# inside arduino setup
# nothing happened yet
Device Init (low)
# starting to initialize
# low level devices
	Memory Init
		EEPROM begin
		# EEPROM is the harddrive of arduino
		# it is used to save memory beyond sessions
		# internally unused flash is used
			ValidateEEPROM (expected / created):
			# Checking if EEPROM is good (signed properly)
			65535 # current sign
			13    # expected sign with current memory
			EEPROM_CORRUPTED
			# obviously the expected does not equal to the
			# current sign, so the EEPROM is corrupted
				Inside FailureHandler
				0 # module = memorymanager
				5 # failureid
				# info from the failurehandle, which would normally
				# be shown though a RGB status led
				# this would result in blue blink 5 times repeated
				# 3 times		
			# because the failurehandler knows that the memorymanager
			# can fix this failure by himself, he lets him handle it
			# instead of restarting
			SignEEPROM (created):
			# because be eeprom before was corrupted, we clear it and
			# write the now computed sign to the eeprom
			13
			# because it is the same as before, we can assume that the
			# memory was properly empty before already
# the device restarts
ESP8266 Boot
Device Init (low)
	Memory Init
		EEPROM begin
			ValidateEEPROM (expected / created):
			13 # current sign
			13 # expected sign
			# now we clearly see that both signs
			# are identical so the eeprom is not
			# corrupted			
	Output Init
		# nothing here should normally not be able
		# to fail but for debug purposes this will 
		# stay here
		LCD Init
		FastLED Init
Device Init (high)
# after the low level devices are initialized
# the more highlevel devices can use the lcd to
# show faults (not failures anymore) instead
# of an RGB led
	WiFi Init (ssid / pass)
		nodemcu			# SSID
		nodemcu________ # PASS
		# the ssid and password are currently hardcoded
		# but will be created randomly in the future
# now should normally be the wifi initialized
# but this is not logged currently		
Device Init finished
# after the device layer is initialized the
# game is instantly started
Found shutdown, continuing normally
# the eeprom is currently completly empty and the
# game loads all the zeros and checks the last saved state
# because the number for shutdown is also zero, it 
# assumes that the last game was shutdown and will
# ignore all other data (empty) and start a new game
Starting session
# this part is currently not logged at all but will be
# in future. the game does load itself and a new state 
# and will try to save it
Boardmanager state changed
# this is currently one of the only log and is not directly
# connected to the start of a session
Saving current session
# the game is now trying to save its newly created session
	SignEEPROM (created):
	# memorymanager is generating a new sign for the eeprom
	# and writing it
	18 # new sign
	# no error message, the initializing succeeded
	
# from now on there arent currently many more
# logs asside from the repeating information for
# the free heap and current wifi connections
	
free heap: 238984
con: 0

# additional info: none of these logs are serial written
# in realese mode
